# Restaurant spin the wheel

This project is to develop a restaurant spin the wheel to interact with through the web. The goal is to provide a user friendly experience on desktop and mobile.

The project will consist of multiple wheels. The first wheel spun will consist of restaurant categories (ex., burgers, sushi, pizza, etc.). The second wheel will consist of restaurants that are a part of that category, so examples for burgers could be McDonald's, Wendy's, A&W, etc.

To summarize:

- First wheel spins to determine the category
- Second wheel contains restaurants depending on the first wheel's spin
- Second wheel spins to determine the restaurant

This is meant to help decide where to eat.

## To-Do

- Add the option to first select categories to add to the wheel
- Solidify the categories and restaurants in each category
- Make it easy to add restaurants to the list
- Abstract both the categories and restaurants into nested arrays?
