# Restaurant spin the wheel

This project is to develop a restaurant spin the wheel to interact with through the web. The goal is to provide a user friendly experience on desktop and mobile.

The project will consist of multiple wheels. The first wheel spun will consist of restaurant categories (ex., burgers, sushi, pizza, etc.). The second wheel will consist of restaurants that are a part of that category, so examples for burgers could be McDonald's, Wendy's, A&W, etc.

This is meant to help decide where to eat.
